          <Heading1>1. MOTIVATION</Heading1>
          <Text>
            Briefly going over the concept of systolic arrays for those who are unfamiliar.

          <Subheading>What is a systolic array?</Subheading>
          <Text>Systolic Arrays are motivated by their efficiency in handling high computational demands in tasks like deep learning and matrix multiplication. Traditional architectures often face bottlenecks from heavy memory access demands, requiring high bandwidth and leading to inefficiencies. In contrast, a systolic array enables data to flow directly between processing units, significantly reducing memory bandwidth requirements and maximizing data reuse within the array.</Text>

          <Subheading>Why systolic arrays?</Subheading>
          <Text>Implementing systolic arrays is a way of applying VLSI design and technology to improve AI/ML algorithms through hardware. Traditional architectures often face bottlenecks from heavy memory access demands, requiring high bandwidth and leading to inefficiencies. In contrast, a systolic array enables data to flow directly between processing units, significantly reducing memory bandwidth requirements and maximizing data reuse within the array.</Text>

        <div>
          <Subheading>Use cases</Subheading>
          <Text>Systolic arrays come in many different architectures to handle a variety of special computations and are often hard-wired for specific operations to perform convolutions, correlations, matrix multiplication, or data sorting tasks. These computations are often bottlenecks in tasks such as image/video processing, or data sequencing.</Text>

          <Heading1>2. THE PROJECT</Heading1>
          <Text>In this project, we were tasked to create a fully custom systolic array that performs a matrix multiplication of two 4x4 matrices.</Text>

          <Heading1>3. RESULTS</Heading1>
          <Text>It works! We are able to multiply any pair of 4x4 matrices. A sample waveform was depicted in the figure below.</Text>
          <Text>  
            <br/>How was our performance? Well, not great. Utilizing a spectre SPICE simulation, our multiplication finishes when the operating frequency is slowed down to 125MHz and our clock period to 8ns. On top of this, our layout area was 120um x 120um and power consumption was about 30uW. 
            <br/><br/>For reference, the top echelon of the class was achieving about a 70um x 70um area with 20uW of power consumption and a 1.7ns clock period (yikes! ðŸ˜¬) .

Unsurprisingly, this applies to VLSI circuits as well. Being unashamed to use another layer to shorten a long global wire proved to help the delay."

          <Text>
            It&apos;s known that semi-custom and/or gate arrays create a faster time to market but at the cost of performance. I want to put this to the test:
            <br /><br />Rather than attempting to redesign a fully custom systolic array, I will utilize libraries of premade components and auto place and route tools to redesign a systolic array and compare its PAD (Power*Delay*Area) score to than the top designs of the class.
